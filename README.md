This codebase provides a simple, decentralized implementation of a client-server communication model using Ethereum's blockchain. The ./client/ directory houses a JavaScript client application powered by Web3.js. This client enables communication with the Ethereum blockchain by interacting with the smart contract located in the ./smart_contract/ directory.

The smart contract is written in Solidity, the language used for Ethereum's smart contracts. It acts as the server-side logic of the application. By using a blockchain-based smart contract, this implementation achieves data integrity, trustworthiness, and decentralization. The client can securely store and retrieve data from the Ethereum blockchain using the smart contract's exposed functions.

In summary, this codebase showcases a practical use case for blockchain-based smart contracts, allowing clients to communicate with servers securely and efficiently through the Ethereum blockchain.
